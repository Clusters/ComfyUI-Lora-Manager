### Filename Format Patterns for Save Image Node

The Save Image Node supports dynamic filename generation using pattern codes. You can customize how your images are named using the following format patterns:

#### Available Pattern Codes

- `%seed%` - Inserts the generation seed number
- `%width%` - Inserts the image width
- `%height%` - Inserts the image height
- `%pprompt:N%` - Inserts the positive prompt (limited to N characters)
- `%nprompt:N%` - Inserts the negative prompt (limited to N characters)
- `%model:N%` - Inserts the model/checkpoint name (limited to N characters)
- `%date%` - Inserts current date/time as "yyyyMMddhhmmss"
- `%date:FORMAT%` - Inserts date using custom format with:
  - `yyyy` - 4-digit year
  - `yy` - 2-digit year
  - `MM` - 2-digit month
  - `dd` - 2-digit day
  - `hh` - 2-digit hour
  - `mm` - 2-digit minute
  - `ss` - 2-digit second

#### Examples

- `image_%seed%` ‚Üí `image_1234567890`
- `gen_%width%x%height%` ‚Üí `gen_512x768`
- `%model:10%_%seed%` ‚Üí `dreamshape_1234567890`
- `%date:yyyy-MM-dd%` ‚Üí `2025-04-28`
- `%pprompt:20%_%seed%` ‚Üí `beautiful landscape_1234567890`
- `%model%_%date:yyMMdd%_%seed%` ‚Üí `dreamshaper_v8_250428_1234567890`

You can combine multiple patterns to create detailed, organized filenames for your generated images.

### Standalone Mode

You can now run LoRA Manager independently from ComfyUI:

1. **For ComfyUI users**:
   - Launch ComfyUI with LoRA Manager at least once to initialize the necessary path information in the `settings.json` file.
   - Make sure dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - From your ComfyUI root directory, run:
     ```bash
     python custom_nodes\comfyui-lora-manager\standalone.py
     ```
   - Access the interface at: `http://localhost:8188/loras`
   - You can specify a different host or port with arguments:
     ```bash
     python custom_nodes\comfyui-lora-manager\standalone.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9000
     ```

2. **For non-ComfyUI users**:
   - Copy the provided `settings.json.example` file to create a new file named `settings.json`
   - Edit `settings.json` to include your correct model folder paths and CivitAI API key
   - Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Run standalone mode:
     ```bash
     python standalone.py
     ```
   - Access the interface through your browser at: `http://localhost:8188/loras`

This standalone mode provides a lightweight option for managing your model and recipe collection without needing to run the full ComfyUI environment, making it useful even for users who primarily use other stable diffusion interfaces.
