## [Update 0.5.4] Support for Extra LoRA Paths via `extra_model_paths.yaml`

- üõ†Ô∏è **Extra LoRA Paths**: Support for additional LoRA paths via extra_model_paths.yaml is now available, offering greater flexibility in managing LoRAs located outside the default directory.

---

## [Update 0.5.3] Improved Preview Handling & Trigger Words Support

- ‚úÖ **Smarter Preview Image Handling**: The manager now automatically scans for and uses existing local preview images. If a local preview is found, it will not re-download one from CivitAI when fetching model details, saving time and bandwidth.

- üìù **Trigger Words in LoRA Details**: Trigger words are now visible in the LoRA details window, making it easier to copy and use them for your workflows.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: For automatic detection, ensure your existing local preview images are named in the following formats:
  - `<lora-file-name>.[png|jpg|jpeg|mp4]`
  - `<lora-file-name>.preview.[png|jpg|jpeg|mp4]`
